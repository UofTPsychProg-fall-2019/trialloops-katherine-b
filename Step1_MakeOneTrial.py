#%% Required set up 
# this imports everything you might need and opens a full screen window
# when you are developing your script you might want to make a smaller window 
# so that you can still see your console 
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import os, sys
from psychopy import visual, core, event, gui, logging

# open a white full screen window
win = visual.Window(fullscr=True, allowGUI=False, color='white', unit='height') 

# uncomment if you use a clock. Optional because we didn't cover timing this week, 
# but you can find examples in the tutorial code 
#trialClock = core.Clock()

#%% up to you!
# this is where you build a trial that you might actually use one day!
# just try to make one trial ordering your lines of code according to the 
# sequence of events that happen on one trial
# if you're stuck you can use the responseExercise.py answer as a starting point 

# maybe start by making stimulus objects (e.g. myPic = visual.ImageStim(...))  
myText1 =visual.TextStim(win,text='happy', pos=(0,0),color='black')



# then draw all stimuli
myText1.draw()


# then flip your window
win.flip()

# then record your responses


#%% Required clean up
# this cell will make sure that your window displays for a while and then 
# closes properly

core.wait(2)
win.close()
